soo there we go 
I am at the point where I have to generate the fractal
- I take a point on the plane (aka pixel)
- I begin top left corner, I first do the full row
then I go down and to zero again and so on
like before
ez pz
- I convert the pixel coordinates to the complex number
>>>complex.r = (px_x - x_zero) * 4 / 1000
>>>complex.i = (y_zero - px_y) * 4 / 1000
- I put number in the function and I iterate iterate
- each iteration, I have some result
- I check if it's within [-2, 2]
-- if it fits in the range, I put it into function again
-- if not, I exit iterating
- I save the number of iterations
-- if iterations are > n (ex. 255), I quit iterating
- once I quit, I go to color function
if there are 255 iter, I keep stuff black
if there are less, I vary the colors accordingly

I convert pixel to complex when I reach a new pixel
I when iterating, I do not convert anymore

do I even have to go through each of the pixel? yes
